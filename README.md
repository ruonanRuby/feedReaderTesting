# Project Overview

In this project, a web-based application that reads RSS feeds is given, also the Jasmine starts file is also included. What I need to do is learning testing from finishing the incomplete test suites.


## How to Open App
### Run the app on the local machine 
- Download/clone the repository and open in your code editor.
- Find the index.html file and open it in a modern browser.
- The Jasmine tests are displayed at the bottom of the index.html page.
- Open the feedreader.js file to code more tests.

### If opened properly, the user will be presented with the Jasmine test result at the bottom of the page, which looks like the image below.
